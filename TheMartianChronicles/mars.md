DFS:
- permuations, paths
- cycles


BFS:
- shortest path
- check levels
- use a Queue




A Tree: an acyclic connected graph with N nodes, N-1 edges, any two vertices have only 1 path


Tree DFS - use a stack
1. Post order: left, right, root
2. Inorder: left, root, right
3. Preorder: root, left, right


Tree BFS:
1. Level Order traversal
  - use a queue
